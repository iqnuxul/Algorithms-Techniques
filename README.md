# Algorithms-Techniques

## 1. Changing Making Problem
Two algorithms greedy and dynamic programming algorithm for change making problem . 
As the result there are information  about how many coins and what coins exactly we need. 

## 2. Sorting
Implementation of the algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort and counting sort.

## 3. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Implement BST tree with operations: 
- Print(tree) 
- Add(tree,value) 
- Find(tree,value) 
- Delete(tree,value)

## 4. Geometry
Implement the algorithm Range searching â€“ As the input we have the list of points. The user provides the ranges, and the program prints the points within it, then the user can repeat it. Write the algorithm using the tree. 

## 5. Data compression 
Implement constructing the Huffman tree for the given set of letters. Implement coding and decoding using Huffman tree.
