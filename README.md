# Algorithms-Techniques

## 1. Changing Making Problem
Two algorithms greedy and dynamic programming algorithm for change making problem . 
As the result there are information  about how many coins and what coins exactly we need. 

## 2. Sorting
Implementation of the algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort and counting sort.
